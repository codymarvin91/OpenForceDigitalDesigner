					Hi {{Recipient.FirstName}},
					<br><br>
					It was great to connect with you at the PCA National Annual Conference in September and to better understand how youâ€™re currently managing your contract caregiver workforce. I believe we can agree the full impact of the 2018 Field Assistance Bulletin is yet to be seen. However, the importance in distinctly understanding the differences between an individual being viewed as a contracted worker vs. an employee that are outlined by the Department of Labor are critically important for your registries' legal protection.
					<br><br>
					That said, I invite you to <a style="color:#ffa400; text-decoration:none;" href="https://attendee.gotowebinar.com/register/1521612344231948803">join us</a> for our next webinar dedicated to this topic. We'll be diving into the 5 critical steps required to navigate the new FAB landscape and provide you with specific information on how to assess your current risk during an audit.
					<br><br>
					I look forward to connecting with you again after the webinar to answer any questions you have on FAB and discuss how Openforce can provide you with protection during your next DOL audit.
					<br><br>
					In the meantime, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
					<br><br>
					Regards,
					<br><br>
					Jane Smith
